        <p style = "font-family: Arial, sans-serif; ">In today's society, several mental health conditions are particularly prevalent due to various factors such as increased stress, societal pressures, technological advancements, and shifts in lifestyle. Some of the most apparent mental health conditions include:</p>
        <ol style = "font-family: Arial, sans-serif; ">
            <li><strong>Anxiety Disorders:</strong> Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias, are among the most common mental health conditions today. With the fast-paced nature of modern life and constant exposure to stressors, many individuals experience persistent feelings of worry, fear, and apprehension.</li>
            <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Depression is another prevalent mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest or pleasure in activities. Factors such as social isolation, economic instability, and the pressure to succeed in various aspects of life contribute to the high prevalence of depression in today's society.</li>
            <li><strong>Stress-Related Disorders:</strong> Chronic stress is a significant concern in modern society, leading to an increased risk of stress-related disorders such as burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and adjustment disorders. Factors such as work pressure, financial stress, relationship difficulties, and societal expectations contribute to the development of these conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):</strong> ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. In today's society, the fast-paced nature of daily life and increased demands on attention and multitasking can exacerbate symptoms of ADHD in both children and adults.</li>
            <li><strong>Eating Disorders:</strong> Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder are prevalent mental health conditions, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Societal pressures to attain unrealistic standards of beauty, as well as cultural emphasis on dieting and weight control, contribute to the development of eating disorders.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep Disorders:</strong> Sleep disorders, including insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome, are increasingly common in today's society due to factors such as irregular sleep schedules, excessive screen time, and high levels of stress and anxiety.</li>
        
        </ol>
        <p style = "font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Addressing these prevalent mental health conditions requires a multifaceted approach involving awareness, education, destigmatization, access to mental health resources, and interventions at individual, community, and societal levels.</p>

        <img src="pic3.jpeg" alt="Image" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; max-width: 350px;">
        <ul style = "font-family: Arial, sans-serif; ">
            <li><strong>Increased Stress:</strong> The fast-paced nature of modern life, along with high levels of work, academic, and social stress, contribute to the development of anxiety, depression, and other stress-related disorders.</li>
            <li><strong>Societal Pressures:</strong> Societal expectations related to success, appearance, and achievement can lead to feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and body image issues, contributing to conditions such as depression, eating disorders, and social media-related disorders.</li>
            <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> While technological advancements have brought numerous benefits, excessive use of digital devices, social media, and online platforms can exacerbate feelings of isolation, comparison, and anxiety, contributing to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and social media-related disorders.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Changes in lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise habits, sleep patterns, and work-life balance can impact mental well-being. Unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and inadequate sleep, can increase the risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Instability:</strong> Economic instability, unemployment, financial stress, and socioeconomic disparities can contribute to feelings of uncertainty, insecurity, and hopelessness, increasing the risk of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Influences:</strong> Cultural norms, beliefs, and attitudes toward mental health play a significant role in shaping individuals' perceptions and experiences. Stigma, discrimination, and lack of awareness surrounding mental health issues can hinder help-seeking behavior and exacerbate symptoms of mental illness.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style = "font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Addressing these underlying factors requires a comprehensive approach involving education, awareness, support services, and policy changes to promote mental well-being and prevent the onset of mental health conditions.</p>
